# Current Development Status

## 📍 Current Phase: Phase 1 - GUI & Linking Foundation

**Legend**: Y = Complete, N = Not Started, O = Ongoing

## ✅ Foundation Work Status
- [x] Basic directory structure created
- [x] Agent instruction system implemented
- [ ] Core data model classes need implementation
- [ ] Basic GUI framework needs establishment
- [ ] Project manager needs implementation
- [ ] PDF processor needs creation
- [ ] CPT manager needs structure

## 🔄 **IMMEDIATE NEXT ACTION**: Start Project Setup

**Current Priority**: The project foundation needs to be established before we can work on the Story Data table.

### Required Setup Steps:
1. **Create basic Python files** with proper structure
2. **Implement core data model classes** (FloorData, etc.)
3. **Set up basic GUI framework** with PyQt6
4. **Create project manager** with pickle save/load
5. **Implement PDF processor** basics
6. **Set up CPT manager** structure

## 🎯 Phase 1 Requirements Status

| Requirement ID | Description | User Story | Expected Behavior/Outcome | Status |
|----------------|-------------|------------|---------------------------|---------|
| P1-FR001 | Story Data Table Creation | As a developer, I need a left panel table to display floor data | Table widget created with proper columns and layout integration | N |
| P1-FR002 | Table Population Logic | As a user, I want to see all floors from the active CPT version | Table automatically populates when CPT version changes | N |
| P1-FR003 | Floor Property Editing | As a user, I want to edit elevation and typical count | Direct table editing updates FloorData objects in real-time | N |
| P1-FR004 | To Be Updated Checkbox | As a user, I want to mark floors for processing | Checkbox column controls FloorData.to_be_updated flag | N |
| P1-FR005 | Three-Table Synchronization | As a user, I want all tables to stay in sync | PDF GA selection triggers CPT table updates | N |
| P1-FR006 | Project State Persistence | As a user, I want my table selections saved | Save/load preserves all table states and user selections | N |
| P1-FR007 | Data Validation | As a user, I want invalid input rejected | Input validation with user-friendly error messages | N |
| P1-FR008 | GUI Responsiveness | As a user, I want the interface to stay responsive | Threading for file operations, progress indicators | N |

## 🎯 Agent Instructions for Current Context

### **IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**:
When prompted to "start" or begin work:

1. **First**: Create the basic project structure and core files
2. **Then**: Implement basic data model classes (especially FloorData)
3. **Next**: Set up basic GUI framework with PyQt6
4. **Finally**: Begin Phase 1 Task 1.1 (Story Data Table)

### Before ANY Phase 1 Work:
- ✅ Verify all foundation files exist
- ✅ FloorData class is implemented
- ✅ Basic GUI framework is established
- ✅ Project structure matches specification



## 📈 Success Metrics for Current Sprint

### Foundation Completion Criteria:
- [ ] All required Python files created with proper structure
- [ ] FloorData class implemented with required properties
- [ ] Basic GUI window can be launched
- [ ] Project manager can save/load pickle files
- [ ] Ready to begin Story Data table implementation

### Definition of "Ready for Phase 1":
1. Basic PyQt6 application runs without errors
2. FloorData objects can be created and modified
3. GUI framework supports adding table widgets
4. Project save/load functionality works
5. All import statements resolve correctly

## 🔄 How Agents Should Use This Status

### **Current Context**: Project Foundation Setup Required
- Focus: Create basic project structure before Phase 1 tasks
- Priority: Foundation files and core classes
- Blocker: Cannot proceed with GUI work until foundation exists

### Next Steps After Foundation:
1. Update this status file to mark foundation as complete
2. Begin Phase 1 Task 1.1 (Story Data Table Creation)
3. Follow the detailed task breakdown in phase_1_gui_linking.md

### Status Update Protocol:
- Mark foundation tasks as O when starting, Y when complete
- Update Phase 1 progress percentage as foundation is established
- Move to Phase 1 tasks only when foundation is 100% complete
